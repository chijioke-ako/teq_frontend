                        Our company appreciates the titanic shift in where
                        business is done, how business is done and who does
                        what. The worldwide expansion of the internet has
                        considerably contributed to the transformation of trade
                        and store transactions. E-commerce, or electronic
                        commerce, largely means buying and/or selling products
                        through the internet and is commonly associated with
                        online shopping. E-commerce according to Statistics and
                        Market Data state that 40 percent of worldwide internet
                        users have bought products or goods online via desktop,
                        mobile, tablet or other online devices as the world
                        shrinks. This amounts to more than 1 billion online
                        buyers and is projected to continuously grow. Businesses
                        are consciously or unconsciously part of it.

                      <p>
                        There are several different types of e-commerce, the
                        most prevalent being B2B (business-to-business), B2C
                        (business-to-consumer) and C2C (consumer-to-consumer)
                        e-commerce. Furthermore, mobile commerce in the shape of
                        buying and selling goods and content via mobile devices
                        such as smartphones is also on the rise. The growth of
                        Mobile commerce is another exciting trend to watch in
                        terms of e-commerce statistics, considering the
                        popularity and widespread use of smartphones and growing
                        usage of tablets.

                        of business. The use of internet is not only huge but
                        continues to grow at astounding rate. The opportunity to
